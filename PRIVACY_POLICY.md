**Published by: Blackboard Studios**
**Last Updated: July 26, 2025**

## Information We Collect

Torrent Snag is designed with privacy as a core principle. We collect minimal information necessary for the extension's functionality:

### Data Stored Locally
- **Torrent Client Configuration**: Server URLs, authentication credentials, and client preferences
- **User Preferences**: Language settings, theme preferences, and performance configurations
- **Detection Patterns**: Custom regex patterns and site-specific configurations
- **Duplicate Tracking**: Hash values of previously processed torrents (for duplicate prevention)

### Data NOT Collected
- **No Personal Information**: We do not collect names, email addresses, or personal identifiers
- **No Browsing History**: We do not track or store your browsing patterns or visited websites
- **No Analytics**: We do not use analytics services or tracking pixels
- **No External Transmission**: No data is transmitted to external servers or third parties

## How We Use Information

All data collected is used solely for:
- **Extension Functionality**: Connecting to your configured torrent clients
- **User Experience**: Remembering your preferences and settings
- **Performance**: Preventing duplicate torrent processing
- **Localization**: Displaying the interface in your preferred language

## Data Storage and Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally in your browser using Chrome's secure storage APIs
- **Encryption**: Sensitive data like passwords are encrypted by Chrome's built-in security
- **No Cloud Sync**: We do not sync your data to any cloud services
- **User Control**: You can delete all stored data by removing the extension

## Third-Party Services

Torrent Snag may communicate with:
- **Your Torrent Clients**: Only the clients you configure (qBittorrent, Transmission, Deluge)

## Data Retention

- **User Control**: You control all data retention through extension settings
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Duplicate tracking data is automatically cleaned up based on your configured limits
